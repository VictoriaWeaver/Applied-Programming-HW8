Piecewise Interpolation with Cubic Splines

Objective: To write a numerical interpolation module in C.  The module will consist of a header file, interp.h,
and a “code file”, called interp.c.  In this module (for now) you will implement functions for cubic spline
interpolation and evaluation for arbitrary sets of data points.
